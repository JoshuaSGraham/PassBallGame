# PassBallGame
A multi-threaded cross-platform multiplayer networked game, where you pass a ball around between clients using a central server.

This was a project that I completed as part of my module CE303 - Advanced Programming at the University of Essex.

The program is aiming to create a multi-threaded networked application that clients connect to a server and pass a ball between currently connected clients only. The game is also made to be cross-platform. This means that clients using a java instance of the game can connect to a server that is running the c# version and vice versa.
